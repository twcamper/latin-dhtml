# [Latin Quizzing Software](https://twcamper.github.io/latin-dhtml/index.html)

Gratefully forked from https://github.com/cmikewilson/latin-dhtml

To run it locally, just open `index.html` or any of the other `*.html` files in your browser.

On your android phone just type `file://` directly into Chrome and then navigate from there (you won't get a `file://` url by opening an html file from within a file manager app.)
